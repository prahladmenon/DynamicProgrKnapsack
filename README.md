====================

[R] Dynamic Programming to deal with the Knapsack problem (toy problem)

Following a Coursera course on optimisation I set up this dynamic programming in R. The code specifically addresses the knapsack problem and should be adapted if other problems are of interest. The basic structure in R should nevertheless remain the same. For more information, turn to the Coursera course on optimisation: https://class.coursera.org/optimization-001/lecture
